v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> poor little flutter of rhymes
would not have been let down the wind: the project would have
been abandoned but for the too flattering encouragement of a
responsible friend.&nbsp; I trust that he may not &ldquo;live to
rue the day,&rdquo; like Keith of Craigentolly in the ballad.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Loyal Lyrics&rdquo; on Charles and James and the
White Rose must not be understood as implying a rebellious desire
for the subversion of the present illustrious dynasty.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;These are but symbols that I sing,<br />
These names of Prince, and rose, and King;<br />
Types of things dear that do not die,<br />
But reign in loyal memory.<br />
<i>Across the water</i> surely they<br />
Abide their twenty-ninth of May;<br />
And we shall hail their happy reign,<br />
When Life comes to his own again,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>over the water that divides us from the voices and faces of
our desires and dreams.</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>Of the
ballads, <i>The Young Ruthven</i> and <i>The Queen of Spain</i>
were written in competition with the street minstrels of the
close of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; The legend on which <i>The
Young Ruthven</i> is based is well known; <i>The Queen of
Spain</i> is the story of the <i>Florencia</i>, a ship of the
Spanish Armada, wrecked in Tobermory Bay, as it was told to me by
a mariner in the Sound of Mull.&nbsp; In <i>Keith of
Craigentolly</i> the family and territorial names of the hero or
villain are purposely altered, so as to avoid injuring
susceptibilities and arousing unavailing regrets.</p>

turned out to grass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Like him who reigned in
Babylon),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forget the seasons overlaid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By business and the Board of Trade:<br />
And sing of old-world lad and lass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the summers that are
gone.</p>
<p class="poetry">Back to the golden prime of Anne!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you ambassador had been,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And brought o&rsquo;er sea the King again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beatrix Esmond in his train,<br />
Ah, happy bard to hold her fan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And happy land with such a
Queen!</p>
<p class="poetry">We live too early, or too late,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have shared the pint of
Pope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And taught, well pleased, the shining shell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To murmur of the fair Lepel,<br />
And changed the stars of St. John&rsquo;s fate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To some more happy horoscope.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fed with chicken and
champagne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Urbane and witty, and too wary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To risk the feud of Lady Mary,<br />
You should have walked the courtly ground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of times that cannot come
again.</p>
<p class="poetry">Bring back these years in verse or prose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I very much prefer your
verse!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As on some Twenty-Ninth of May<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Restore the splendour and the sway,<br />
Forget the sins, the wars, the woes&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The joys alone must you
rehearse.</p>
<p class="poetry">Forget the dunces (there is none<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So stupid as to snarl at
<i>you</i>);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So may your years with pen and book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Run pleasant as an English brook<br />
Through meadows floral in the sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shadows fragrant of the
dew.</p>
<p class="poetry">And thus at ending of your span&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As all must end&mdash;the world
shall say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;His best he gave: he left us not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A line that saints could wish to blot,<br />
For he was blameless, though a man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And though the poet, he was
gay!&rdquo;</p>

for her great destrier,<br />
But he lashed like a fiend when the Maid drew near:<br />
&ldquo;Lead him forth to the Cross!&rdquo; she cried, and he
stood<br />
Like a steed of bronze by the Holy Rood!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I saw the Maiden mount and ride,<br />
With a good steel sperthe that swung by her side,<br />
And girt with the sword of the Heavenly Bride,<br />
That is sained with crosses five for a sign,<br />
The mystical sword of St. Catherine.<br />
And the lily banner was blowing wide,<br />
With the flowers of France on the field of fame<br />
And, blent with the blossoms, the Holy Name!<br />
And the Maiden&rsquo;s blazon was shown on a shield,<br />
<i>Argent</i>, <i>a dove</i>, <i>on an azure field</i>;<br />
That banner was wrought by this hand, ye see,<br />
For the love of the Maid and chivalry.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Her banner was borne by a page of grace,<br />
With hair of gold, and a lady&rsquo;s face;<br />
And behind it the ranks of her men were dressed&mdash;<br />
Never a man but was clean confessed,<br />
Jackman and archer, lord and knight,<br />
Their souls were clean and their hearts were light:<br />
There was never an oath, there was never a laugh,<br />
And La Hire swore soft by his leading staff!<br />
Had we died in that hour we had won the skies,<br />
And the Maiden had marched us through Paradise!</p>
<p class="poetry">A moment she turned to the people there,<br />
Who had come to gaze on the Maiden fair;<br />
A moment she glanced at the ring she wore,<br />
She murmured the Holy Name it bore,<br />
Then, &ldquo;For France and the King, good people pray!&rdquo;<br
/>
She spoke, and she cried to us, &ldquo;<i>On and
away</i>!&rdquo;<br />
And the shouts broke forth, and the flowers rained down,<br />
And the Maiden led us to Orleans town.</p>

Fount that wells in the cave,<br />
Voice of the burn and the wave,<br />
Softly you sing and clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Charlie and his men!</p>
<p class="poetry">Here has he lurked, and here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heather has been his bed,<br />
The wastes of the islands knew<br />
And the Highland hearts were true<br />
To the bonny, the brave, the dear,<br />

Nay, worse, in his infatuate mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He ends a line &ldquo;explainer,&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Until he reaches Jena(r).</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, G&mdash;y shines the worst of all,<br />

But Waller, if to Cytherea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He prayed at any time,<br />
Did not implore &ldquo;her friendly ear,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And think he had a rhyme.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, if you ask to what are due<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The horrors which I mention,<br />
I think we owe them to the U-<br />

From Hoxton and from Poplar come<br />

And so the Oxford Muse is dumb,<br />

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
